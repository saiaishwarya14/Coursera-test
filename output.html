<pre> <h1>THE PREDICTED CROP FOR THE SOIL COMPONENTS IS 
                    "PADDY"  <h1></pre>

<p><h3><b>Pests that might attack paddy are</b></h3></p>
<p><b><h3>1)Bacterial leaf streak:</h3></b>
     <pre><img src="C:\Users\VISWANATH\Downloads\Bacterial leaf steeak.jpg" alt="img" style="width:80px"></pre>
	 <b><h3>Symptoms:</h3></b>
         Small, water-soaked streaks between leaf veins which are initially dark green and then turn translucent;
         streaks grow larger, coalesce and turn light brown in color; 
         tiny beads of yellow colored bacterial exudate are common on the surface of the streaks;
         leaves turn brown and then gray-white in color before they die.
	 <b><h3>Management:</h3></b>
          Control of bacterial leaf streak is dependent on the use of resistant rice varieties and on planting of treated seed</p>
<p><b><h3>2)Leaf scald:</h3></b>
     <pre><img src="C:\Users\VISWANATH\Downloads\2.jpg" alt="img" style="width:80px"></pre>
	 <b><h3>Symptoms:</h3></b>
         As name suggest we will see scalded appearance on leaves.
		 The lesion is marked with different zone from alternating light tan and dark brown from leaf tips or edges.
		 As the leaves mature the lesion is with light brown halos. Margins and leaf tips are translucent.
	 <b><h3>Management:</h3></b>
          Grow resistant varieties. Treat the seeds with suitable fungicide. Apply only recommended quantity of nitrogen fertilizer in split dose.</p><br/><br/>
<p><h1>FERTLIZER DETAIL</h1></p>
<p><b>UREA</b>: 80kg for one hectare or 4kg for one kanal area</p>
<p><b>DAP</b>:  130kg for one hectare or 6.5kg for one kanal area</p>
<p><b>MOP</b>:  51kg for one hectare or 2.55kg for one kanal area</p>

<p><h1>Water Detail</h1></p>
<p>A general rule is that a rice crop will need approximately 10mm of water per day.
 Therefore a crop that matures in 100 days will require approximately 1000mm of water
 while a crop that matures in 150 days will require 50% more.</p>
